|I remember|
|遥远的 虚幻的时刻|
|反复发作|
|像是顽疾般的自我谴责|
|I remember|
|协同着 过往的场合|
|肆意高歌|
|践踏我故事的转承起合|
|Show me all smile again|
|Show me all truth again|
|Show me all love again|
|I want to fly away so far|
|是谁 将我困在无声的黑白|
|Tell me I don't cry|
|You know I don't cry|
|回忆碎成块|
|拼凑不全 醒不过来|
|Maybe I don't cry|
|持披剑与铠 向着星与海|
|奔赴而去 不停下来|
|Beyond the time|
|To live to love|
|Beyond the time|
|To live to love|
|身旁两侧|
|有声音 耳边吟唱着|
|熟悉的歌|
|缓缓将记忆的裂痕愈合|
|我的角色|
|不会等 剧本的转折|
|就算坎坷|
|依然坚定着自己的选择|
|Show me all smile again|
|Show me all truth again|
|Show me all love again|
|I want to fly away so far|
|无畏 恐惧未知充斥的未来|
|Tell me I don't cry|
|You know I don't cry|
|回忆碎成块|
|拼凑不全 醒不过来|
|Maybe I don't cry|
|持披剑与铠 向着星与海|
|奔赴而去 不停下来|
|Beyond the time|
|To live to love|
|Beyond the time|
|To live to love|
|We are searching for the light|
|We are searching for the light|
|We are searching for the light|
|I want to fly away so far|
|就算被绝望抓住脚踝|
|也依然向着光 狠狠地盛开|
|Tell me I don't cry|
|You know I don't cry|
|回忆碎成块|
|醒不过来|
|Maybe I don't cry|
|持披剑与铠 向着星与海|
|奔赴而去 不停下来|
|Beyond the time|
|To live to love|
|Beyond the time|
|To live to love|
